# Software

A list of software for which I have configs:

* iTerm2 (deprecated)
* tmux (deprecated)
* Vim
* Kitty
* Quake3
* Custom layout for GH60Satan 60% keyboard (see `keyboard` folder)

Favourite font: [Fira Code Retina](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)

# Install

Check `Makefile`. By default you can try to run:

```shell
$ make install
```

## Vim

You can use `vim_update.sh` script to build Vim with the flags I care about.

The next step is to install package manager - [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

I use [coc](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) for autocompletion. If you see some errors - run `:CocInfo` and fix what is broken.
